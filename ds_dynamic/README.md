<h2> Problem "New List Operations" </h2>
<ol>
  <li>
  You must implement the method "insereSemRepetir" in the List (Lista.java) so that it inserts an item only if there is no other item in the list with the same key as the item to insert. <a href="./autoreferencia/Lista.java#L72" target="_blank">Check Solution</a> 
  </li>
  <li>
  You must implement the method "uneLista" in the List (Lista.java) so that it concatenates a list, given in the parameter, to its end. <a href="./autoreferencia/Lista.java#L87" target="_blank">Check Solution</a> 
  </li>
  
  <li>
  You must implement a class that tests the methods implemented for the previous itens. <a href="./TestaListaAutoReferenciada.java" target="_blank">Check Solution</a> 
  </li>
</ol>

<br>
<br>
  
  
<h2> Problem "Stack Test" </h2>
<ol>
<li>
Define a method on the stack (Pilha.java) that prints the elements of the stack on the screen, in stack format. <a href="./autoreferencia/Pilha.java#L35" target="_blank">Check Solution</a> 
</li>
<li>
Test the method  that prints the stack on the screen, in stack format. <a href="./autoreferencia/Exercicio16.java" target="_blank">Check Solution</a> 
</li>
</ol>  
<br>
<br>
<br>
  
<h2> Problem "Stack of Reminders" </h2>
<ul>
  <li>
  Define a class that represents a Reminder entity. Your reminder must contain at least a text (String) and the time for notification. Assume that the notification time is an integer value informed by the user and formed by the concatenation of hour and minute. Example: 16:03 --> 1603. <a href="./Lembrete.java" target="_blank">Check Solution</a> 
  </li>
  <li>Your program should allow the user to create as many reminders as they want.</li>
  <li>Make a program that keeps these reminders in a list as they are generated. Then put them in a stack so that the more recent the notification time, the higher up it is in the stack. At the end, show the reminders to the user, displaying the most recent notification first to the most distant notification.</li>

</ul>

<h2> Problem "New Queue Operations" </h2>
<ul>
  <li>
  Implement a method that prints the queue items in the order they were queued (oldest first and newest last). Create a test class that demonstrates the use of the method you created.<a href="./autoreferencia/Fila.java#L30" target="_blank"> Check Solution (part1)</a> <a href="./Exercicio21.java" target="_blank"> Check Solution (part2)</a> 
  </li>
  <li>
  Implement a method on the queue in which, given another queue, it creates a third queue by interleaving the elements of the second with those of the first. Start merging with the queue that contains the method.<a href="./autoreferencia/Fila.java#L42" target="_blank"> Check Solution (part1)</a> <a href="./Exercicio22.java" target="_blank"> Check Solution (part2)</a> 
  </li>
</ul>
