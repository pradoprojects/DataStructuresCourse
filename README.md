Welcome to the Data Structures Course repo. Here, you will find implementations for Data Structure problems that I taught to my undergrad students. I taught the course in Java language. I coded the data structures from the ground instead of using data structures provided by the Java Documentation.

The repo is organized as follows:
  
* _ds_array_: Problems and solutions defined over array implementations of list, stacks and queues data structures.

* _ds_dynamic: Problems and solutions defined over dynamic implementations of list, stacks and queues data structures.
